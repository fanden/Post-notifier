# Post-notifier

Simple python script to notify user if their packgage has a new update via the Norwegian post service's public API

Nothing fancy at all, first python code I've ever written and was made to solve a problem I had

Hope someone else might find it usefull

To enable the notification sound put a .wav file in the same directory as the python fuile, call it "notify.wav" and change the "notifyOption" from Fale to True
